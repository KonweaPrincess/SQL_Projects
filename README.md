# sql_projects


Welcome to my repository containing SQL projects. In this repository, you will find a diverse collection of some of my personal projects that demonstrate my proficiency in writing SQL queries. These projects cover a spectrum of various topics, such as database design, database manipulation, analysis, data filtering, and extraction. For each project, you can explore the SQL codes used and discover the problems addressed along with the insights gained from the analysis. This repository will come in handy whether you are looking to improve your SQL skills or you are an experienced developer seeking inspiration for your next project. I hope that you find a project that is insightful and valuable to you.
